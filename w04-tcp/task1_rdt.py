"""Week 4 · Task 1 — Build reliable delivery on top of an unreliable channel.

Textbook §3.4 (reliable data transfer) and §3.5 (TCP's sequence numbers).

`UnreliableChannel` below loses packets, reorders them, duplicates them, and
delays them. It is the network as §3.4 models it. Your job is to move a file
across it and have the bytes arrive intact and in order.

That is the whole of TCP's reliability story with the congestion control taken
out, and it is worth building once by hand before you ever trust a socket again.
