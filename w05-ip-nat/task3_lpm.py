"""Week 5 · Task 3 — Make longest-prefix match fast.

Textbook §4.3.3.

`LinearTable` is correct and it is what you probably wrote in Task 1: keep the
prefixes in a list, check every one, remember the longest that matched. On six
entries that is fine. A real router holds close to a million, and it has to
answer while the packet is still in the buffer.

Beat it:

    python3 bench.py
    python3 bench.py --yours

Correctness first: `bench.py` checks every one of your answers against the
linear table. A fast router that forwards to the wrong next hop is not a
router, it is an outage.

    Addresses and networks are plain 32-bit ints here - no strings, no parsing,
    so that the benchmark measures your lookup and nothing else.

    Two directions worth knowing about before you pick one:

      * group by prefix length. There are only 33 possible lengths, and you can
        ask them in an order that lets you stop early.
      * walk the address one bit at a time. Each bit takes you to at most one
        child, so the work is bounded by the address width, not by the table size.

    The second is what hardware does. The first is easier and often enough.
    Say which you chose and what it cost you in memory.
